| ![flush-cutters](flush-cutters.webp) | flush cutters                   | These will come in handy for some parts.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ![flux](flux.webp)                   | extra flux / flux pen           | Extra Flux can be helpful when soldering. Flux makes the solder flow better into the cavities and generally helps get a good solder joint.                                                                           |
| ![iso](iso.webp)                     | isopropyl alcohol / PCB cleaner | IPA or PCB Cleaner is super cool to make the PCB look good after you are done soldering.                                                                                                                             |
| ![brass-sponge](brass-sponge.webp)   | brass sponge                    | With a brass sponge you can clean the tip of the soldering iron. A brass sponge is a small investement but surely a good one! It makes soldering that much easier when you can work with a clean soldering iron tip! |
