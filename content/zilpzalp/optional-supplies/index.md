| ![flux](flux.webp)                 | extra flux / flux pen           | Extra Flux can be helpfull when soldering. Flux makes the solder flow better into the cavities and generally helpes get a good solder joint.                                                                         |
| ![iso](iso.webp)                   | isopropyl alcohol / PCB cleaner | IPA or PCB Cleaner is super cool to make the PCB look good after you are done soldering.                                                                                                                             |
| ![brass-sponge](brass-sponge.webp) | brass sponge                    | With a brass sponge you can clean the tip of the soldering iron. A brass sponge is a small investement but surely a good one! It makes soldering that much easier when you can work with a clean soldering iron tip! |
