Here you can find the instructions for assembling the Splaytoraid.

The PCB comes presoldered with all the small SMD components. You just need to solder on bigger components like hotswap sockets and a ProMicro.

However, if you experience any issues during assembly, don't hesitate to shoot us an e-mail or come over to our Discord server!
