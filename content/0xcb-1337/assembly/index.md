Let's start the assembly with the PCB.
![pcb2](pcb2.jpg)

<br>If you want to solder your 1337 with the Mill-Max sockets then you should start with those. You also can solder the switches directly. If you want to do that skip the Mill-Max soldering.
![switchmillmax](switchmillmax.jpg)

<br>Get your bag of sockets ready and take them out. Place them all in the holes of the PCB from the top. That is the side where no components are visible.
![socketspcb](socketspcb.jpg)

<br>Now you have to secure the sockets so that you can turn around the PCB for soldering. We always use kapton tape for that. You can also use other tapes, just make sure that they are heat resistant.

<br>Turn around the PCB and solder the sockets. Here it is important that the solder doesn't flow into the hole in the top. So add solder from the side until you have a decent amount. You don't need a lot here, just enough so that it holds itself.

<br>Get yourself the ribbon cable. Seperate the ends and strip them. They should look like this.
![ribbon](ribbon.jpg)

<br>Put them into the PCB and solder them in. Solder them from the side where you can read the lables for the holes (GND, VCC...). If you are having troubles getting them in there you can also seperate the cables completely.
![ribbonsolder](ribbonsolder.jpg)

<br>Put the PCB into the case and place a few switches in there. We will temporarily place the PCB in there to cut the ribbon cable to the right lenght. You will have to take off the bottom plate and OLED covers for this.
![pcbincase1](pcbincase1.jpg)

<br>Straighten out the cable and cut it roughly at the edge of the case. If you have never isolated cables before you should try it out first and leave the cable a little bit longer. That shouldn't be a problem.
![ribboncut](ribboncut.jpg)

<br>Now take out the PCB again and solder in the OLED. Be aware of the orientation here! If you turn it the wrong way around the OLED will not work and also will not fit into the case.
![oledribbon](oledribbon.jpg)

<br>Onto the encoder! You will have to push the big pins of the encoder together so that you can push it into the PCB later. Also take off the Knob and washer now and put them aside. The Knob can be taken off by taking out the little screw from the side with the big allen key.
![rotary](rotary.jpg)

<br>Place the encoder on the PCB. Orientation matters here again. The encoder goes on the side where the MillMax-Sockets and switches also go.
![rotaryinpcb](rotaryinpcb.jpg)

<br>Solder in the encoder from the back. Be careful here so that you don't touch other small components!
![rotaryinpcbsolder](rotaryinpcbsolder.jpg)

<br>Put all switches into the case.
![switchcase](switchcase.jpg)

<br>Push the PCB onto the switches. If you have Mill-Maxed your 1337 this will require a bit of force and accuracy. If you have not Mill-Maxed your 1337 solder in your switches now. Make sure to press the PCB completely onto the switches so that it sits nicely.
![pcbincase2](pcbincase2.jpg)

<br>Put the OLED through the bottom of the case and place it on top of the ledge.
![oledincase](oledincase.jpg)

<br>Put on the bottom plate. The plate is not symetrical! The bottom plate has two cutouts that go in the back to the USB port and OLED wires. Make sure that your bottom plate sits flush in there.
![bottom](bottom.jpg)

<br>Screw in the bottom plate now. Don't tighten the screws too much. You are screwing right into plastic and the screws don't need to hold much anyway.
![bottomscrew](bottomscrew.jpg)

<br>Place the two OLED covers on there and screw them together. You also want to remove the protective cover before that. Also check, if you have cables sticking out from the top. If you do, clip them off so that the cover will fit.
![oledcover](oledcover.jpg)

<br>You need to put a bit of force on the back for the screw to grab the back piece. But again don't tighten the screws to much. You have a screen sitting under there that can crack.
![oledscrew](oledscrew.jpg)

<br>Screw in the nut for the Encoder.
![rotarywasher](rotarywasher.jpg)

<br>Put on the knob and tighten the screw from the side.
![knob](knob.jpg)

<br>Put on your keycaps as a last step.
![keycaps](keycaps.jpg)

<br><br>And you are done with your 1337!
