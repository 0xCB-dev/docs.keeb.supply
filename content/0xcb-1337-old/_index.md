This is an outdated version of the instructions!!! 

Newer revisions of the 1337 come preassembled and don't need instructions anymore.
If you have bought your Macro Pad after April of 2023 then these instructions are not important for you.

[New Version]({{< ref "/0xcb-1337/" >}})

<br>Here you can find the instructions for assembling the 0xCB 1337 macro pad.

The PCB comes presoldered, you just need to solder some bigger components.

However, if you experience any issues during assembly, don't hesitate to shoot us an e-mail or come over to our Discord server!
