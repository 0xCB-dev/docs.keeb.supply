## PCB

Let's start the assembly with the PCB. It does not matter if you have the barebones or case variant here.
![]()

<br>You can start by soldering on your hotswap sockets. You can find Instructions on how to solder hotswap sockets [here]({{< ref "basics/soldering/hotswap#choc-low-profile" >}}).
![]()

<br>After that you can solder on your Controller. You can lay the RP2040 Zero directly onto the PCB and solder it on there. Just add solder to the sides of the pads and be careful that it sits straight.

<br>Now solder on the 6 through hole buttons.

<br>You should test your PCB now if it is fully working.

Skip to the next section depening on the kit you have:
<br>[barebones version]({{< ref "stress/assembly#barebones-assembly" >}})
<br>[case version]({{< ref "stress/assembly#case-assembly" >}})


## barebones assembly

If you have the barebones kit, assembly is almost finished now. As a next step you can put in your switches.

<br>After that put on your keycaps.
![]()

<br>Now you just have to put on your Rubber feet and your are done!

## case assembly

<br>In the case version you can also start with the switches, but here you will have to put the switch plate between the switches and PCB.
