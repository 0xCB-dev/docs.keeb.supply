Here you can find the instructions for assembling the 0xCB TutelPad.

The PCB comes presoldered with the SMD LEDs. You just need to solder on the bigger through hole components. This makes it really beginner friendly.

However, if you experience any issues during assembly, don't hesitate to shoot us an e-mail or come over to our Discord server!
