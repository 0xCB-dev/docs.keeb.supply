| ![case](case.jpg) | Flush Cutters  | You will need these to cut the wires needed for the OLED.                                                                                     |
| pcb               | Soldering Iron | We recomment a good soldering iron! Don't expect a challenge like the USB Port on the Static tho, the soldering on the 1337 is rather simple. |
| encoder           | Solder         | Please use high quality solder (flux core or apply flux externally) to make your life easier when soldering this kit!                         |  |
