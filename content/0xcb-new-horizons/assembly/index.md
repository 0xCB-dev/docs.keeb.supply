## PCB

Let's start the assembly with the PCB.
![]()

<br>If you want to solder in MillMax-Sockets you should do that now! You can find instructions for that [here]({{< ref "/basics/soldering/mill-max" >}}).
![]()

<br>Please solder in the headers for the controller now. You can find instructions for that [here]({{< ref "/basics/soldering/promicro" >}}).
![]()

<br>If you want to install a rotary encoder into your PCB you can also do this now. You can find instructions for that [here]({{< ref "/basics/soldering/ec11" >}}). The encoder goes on the top right of the PCB where your delete key would be located.
![]()

<br>The PCB also supports a speaker. If you want you can also solder one in now. You can find information on speakers [here]({{< ref "/basics/hardware/speakers" >}}). The speaker is located on the back of the PCB around the controller area.
![]()

<br>This is everything you need to solder for now!

### Controller

Let's get your controller ready!
![]()

<br>You have to flash the controller. You can find the firmware <a href="https://github.com/0xCB-dev/0xCB-NewHorizons/releases" >here<a>. And instructions on how to flash a controller [here]({{< ref "/basics/firmware/flashing" >}}).<br>
![git](git.webp)

<br> Plug in your controller now and see if it pops up in [VIAL]({{< ref "/basics/firmware/viaandvial#VIAL" >}}).

<br>If your controller is working, you can solder it in. Instructions on how to do that can be found [here]({{< ref "/basics/soldering/promicro#promicro" >}}). When you have the PCB in front of you so that you can read the text on it, the USB port should go to the top of the PCB. You should not see the components of the micro controller, when it is sitting in the PCB.
![]()

<br>When you have your controller soldered in, it is good practice to do a [matrix test]({{< ref "/basics/firmware/viaandvial#matrix-testing" >}}).
![]()

<br>If all keys are working your PCB assembly is finished for now.

## Assembly

### PCB assembly

If you are beginning this step we expect you have a fully working PCB in front of you.
![]()

For the next steps it's probably useful to open the KLE so you can check where you want everything layout wise. You can find ther here. PLS INSERT LINK

<br>You should start with the stabilisers. Depending on the layout you will need to put them in at different spots and in differenty quantities.
![]()

<br>After your stabilisers, you will need to 
![]()

<br>If all keys are working your PCB assembly is finished for now.
![]()









<br><br>And you are done with your 0xCB New Horizons!
