## Header Pins
You can use IC-hotswap sockets or the solder variant that most likely came with your micro controller.

<br>Place the header pins inside the through holes on the PCB.

<br>Turn around the PCB. Pay close attention to the straightness of the headers.

<br>First solder only one pin per header.

<br>Then check if they are straight and a controller can fit on them. If they are not straight, heat up the one pin and realign them.

<br>You can go ahead and solder the rest if they are straight.
