## Diodes

Here we will show you how to solder small diodes. There are single and double diodes which are being used in keyboards.

### Single Diodes

Start by adding solder to one of the pads.

<br>With single diodes it is important to get the orientation right. Please align the line on the Diode with the marking on the PCB.

<br>Then just add your component to the pad and heat up the solder again to fix it in place.

<br>After that just add solder to the remaining leg.

### Double Diodes

With double diodes you cannot really orient them wrong. They should align with the pads. Start by adding solder to one of the pads.
